BLAT Alignment phase

- download genome (store in /files/share/data/thirdparty/...)
- loadGenomeVirtualSequence
- loadGenomeGaps
- loadGenomeSeq
- copy genome sequence to liniac (does it need to be formatted for BLAT?)
- extract DT sequences w/o description
- copy to liniac
- on liniac:
    - pre-process genome sequences on liniac
    - run BLAT
- bring results back
- loadBLATAlignment
