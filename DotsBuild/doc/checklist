CHECKLIST FOR GETTING READY TO START A BUILD

- update property files

- update dbEST mirror

- confirm cdd regex (&insertCDD)

- confirm all wget commands (ie that the files are still at the expected url)

- prepareDownloadSiteFiles sub fails and needs to be fixed-files have been gzip'd in earlier subs and this sub altered but I'm not sure it works.
