DoTS Website To Do

Queries
  - convert external ID queries (eg GeneCards) to "gene" queries
  - HQ queries
  - TESS queries
  - GeneNet
  - batch BLAST
  - batch submit DTs
  - add U133 affy query

Documentation
  - Improve statistics page (probably wait till new cluster alg)
  - Use cases
  - Tutorial
  - White papers on algorithms (eg, confidence)

Features
  - New gene-centric transcript list display
  - User sorting
  - global navigation of pages?
  - Shopping cart (ie, hand picked DTs to add to a set)
  - find transcripts similar to the one in hand
  - "Refine": make a new query by adjusting params of query from history
  - Display coding/non-coding in transcript page header
  - Display confidence in transcript page header
  - add coding/non-coding and confidence columns to ReportMaker
  - offer fasta file as optioal format for ReportMaker
  - map RAD to DoTS?
  - the gene page should check for old DG in mergesplit and put out history page
  - BLAST should do something to prevent timing out on long tblastn jobs

Website Build
  - find hard coded urls get them into the config files
  - move project into new CVS structure

After Genome Clustering
  - gene based queries
     - gene location
     - gene quality (just re-word the query)
     - gene confidence

Future
  - model alternative splices (ie, remove constraint of EST belonging to 1 DT)
  - move to RNAs from na_sequences



DONE
  - news: tracks at ensembl and ucsc
  - DG query
    - replace "genes" tab with "query"
  - revise home page text (and elsewhere) to emphasize DoTS instead of allgenes
  - from assembly page, links to refseq is broken
  - complete the upgrade to GUS 3.0
  - move to release 6 of dots
  - batch submission
     - email notification??
  - history mode upgrade (jonathan?)
  - report generating
     - develop interface to control modular report generator 
     - include sequence in report (based on landmark)
     - include protein sequence too.
  - finish build 6
  - find ALL hard coded urls and db_ids and get them into the config files!
  - move .gus.properties to a place outside of gushome so they don't get clobbered
  - fix trimming in repeatmask
  - upgrade query page: collapse id queries into one pull down.
  - coding/non-coding query (for DT and DG)
  - coding/non-coding query
  - add promoter region column to ReportMaker
