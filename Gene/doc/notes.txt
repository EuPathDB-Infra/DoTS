Subject: DoTS Genes custom tracks update (human DoTS 9 vs hg17 and mouse DoTS 9 vs mm5)

Dear UCSC genome team,
I am pleased to submit our latest human (DoTS 9 vs hg17) and mouse (DoTS 9 vs mm5)
DoTS Gene analysis results to update the version currently on your site.

Attached please find two html files (DotsUcscHum.htm for human and
DotsUcscMus.htm for mouse) with snippets of code that can be directly
plugged into the custom tracks page. We would appreciate it if you could
make the update at your earliest convenience.
  
DoTS (Database Of Transcribed Sequences) is a human and mouse transcript index
created from all publicly available transcript sequences. The input 
sequences are clustered and assembled to form the DoTS Consensus 
Transcripts that comprise the index. The DoTS Transcripts and DoTS Genes
are extensively annotated and a significant number have been manually curated.
The focus of the DoTS project is integrating the various types of data
(e.g., EST sequences, genomic sequence, expression data, functional
annotation) in a structured manner which facilitates sophisticated queries 
that are otherwise not easy to perform. DoTS Genes are created by aligning 
DoTS Transcripts to the genome and merging selected alignments into gene models.

# Dots gene pipeline notes:

Some of the Dots Gene pipeline steps are duplicated
instead of imported from DotsBuild pipeline steps.
This is because the "mgr"s each assume its own distinct buildDir.
May consider combining the prop files and make Dots Gene pipeline
part of the DotsBuild pipeline in the future.
